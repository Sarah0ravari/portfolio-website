# Portfolio Website ðŸŒ¤
My portfolio website dedicated to sharing projects, hobbies, and who I am :)

## Goals

- Solid design using Figma
- Single Page Application using React
- Mobile first design -- responsive. Aim is to be simple.
- Good git workflow
- Hosted on AWS
- Standard portfolio website features + pages
    - Portfolio (list of past projects - grid view)
    - About (bio, hobbies, paintins)
    - Resume (experience, courses completed)
    - Contact (email, links to socials)
- Some animation on page change (swipe style, left right navigation - add arrows onHover, enable arrow key?)

## Git Workflow

1. Get up to date. On main branch:
    <br> `git fetch`
    <br> `git pull origin main`

2. Create a new feature branch:
    `git checkout -b [feature-branch-name]`
    
3. Work on feature ...

4. When ready, save progress. In project root directory:
    <br> `git add .`
    <br> `git commit -m "Added logo"`
    
5. Push branch to Github
    `git push origin [feature-branch-name]`
    
6. In Github dashboard, click button that pops up to create pull request.

7. Self-review code. If looks good (no merge conflicts) click green Squash and Merge button
